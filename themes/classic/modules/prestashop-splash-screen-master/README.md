Splash Screen for Prestashop
============================

A simple PrestaShop module to show a splash screen when entering the shop.

### Requirements
* PrestaShop 1.5.5+

### Configuration
In the settings you can choose :

* CMS page that will be included in your splash screen
* Redirection address, a user who doesn't want to enter on your website will be redirected to that URL
* Cookie expiration time in days, for now it should be between 1 and 365

**Note:** any change made on the cookie expiration value will reset the cookie, customers will see the splash screen again.
